I am an undergraduate student at the University of California, Santa Barbara, pursuing a double major in Statistics & Data Science (B.S.) and Economics & Accounting (B.A.). My academic and professional interests lie in applying data-driven methodologies to solve complex problems in finance, operations, and organizational strategy.

My experience spans data system development, math and accounting. In my sophomore year, I served as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant in the [Mathematics Department, University of California, Santa Barbara](https://www.math.ucsb.edu/) where I evaluated assignments, provided feedback, and supported students in understanding core mathematical concepts. I am currently leading the development of an internal operations platform for a student organization, involving a SQL-based user database and a custom web interface to enhance workflow coordination.

Proficient in Python, R, SQL, JavaScript, and Stata, I am continually expanding my technical skill set while staying grounded in the principles of clarity, accountability, and collaboration. I am particularly interested in the intersection of data infrastructure, financial processes, and scalable decision-making systems.
